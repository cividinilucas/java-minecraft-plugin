# java-minecraft-plugin

In this repository we will be developing a minecraft plugin as we learn Spigot and Bukkit development.

### Java Version:
We will be using Amazon Corretto 1.8 Java version to develop

### Spigot and Minecraft Version
Spigot 1.16.5, which you can download [here](https://getbukkit.org/get/RD0y91OTotryPrElNQe4ovBLDNweoO5Z).
Which, of course, may need to use the version 1.16.5 version of Minecraft.


### Suggestion:
ASDF is a universal programming languages' version manager that you can use to manage many versions of almost every known programming language. 
You can install it following the documentation available [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) according to the Shell and OS you use.
As ASDF works with plugins, you will need to add a java plugin so you can use and manage java versions with it. You can get the plugin from [this repository](https://github.com/halcyon/asdf-java)
> By the way, after you successfully get the java plugin you can use `asdf install java corretto-8.412.08.1` to get the version we are using for now.
